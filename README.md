# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction using Neural Networks
📘 Description

This project uses a neural network to predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on features such as sex, age, ticket class, and more. It's an ideal project for beginners who want to get started with neural networks in binary classification tasks.
🧠 Objectives

1. Preprocess the data (cleaning, encoding, normalization)

2. Build a simple neural network using Keras/TensorFlow

3. Train the model and evaluate its performance

4. Visualize the results and interpret predictions

📁 Repository Contents

    Titanic_Survival_NN.ipynb – Main notebook with all the steps

🧪 Libraries Used

    Python 3.11+

    NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

    Scikit-learn

    TensorFlow / Keras

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/thomassalamone/titanic-prediction-nn.git

Launch the notebook:

    jupyter notebook Titanic.ipynb

📊 Results

The model achieves approximately 80% accuracy on the test set (replace with your actual value).
The confusion matrix shows good performance in classifying survived vs. non-survived passengers.
🔧 Possible Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning

- Adding regularization techniques (dropout, L2)

- More advanced feature engineering

- Comparison with other models (Random Forest, SVM)
